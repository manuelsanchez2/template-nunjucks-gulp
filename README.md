## About this repo

This is a very complete template that will help you start to code ASAP.

It is a setup that contains:
- Gulp with Nunjucks.js 
- Some templates with partials/components (nav, footer, schema.org and favicon)
- Some mock pages so that you can see how it works!

### Installation

1. You just need to clone/download this repo and use "npm install".
2. Next go to the gulpfile.js file and check what I did there. Hope it is clear with the comments: just write in your terminal gulp or gulp index to rerender the files. As simple as that. You change the files inside the src folder and then you gulp them.
